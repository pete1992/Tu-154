 
Meet the legendary Tu-154M!

From its first flight in 1968, this aircraft became the most popular jetliner in the USSR and many neighboring countries. A total of 918 were built, and some are still in service worldwide.
This model represents the most detailed simulation of the real Tu-154, with accurate systems, performance, and flight dynamics. The development draws on documents, blueprints, 
videos, and direct consultation with pilots, engineers, and ground personnel. As a reference, the real Tu-154M reg. No. 85748 from Belavia Airlines was used.

Current features:

  -  Fully functional 3D cockpit
  -  Fully animated external model with ground support equipment
  -  Dynamic HDR lighting
  -  TCAS with TA/RA mode
  -  EGPWS with "Terrain ahead" warning
  -  Highly accurate and complex systems, simulated as close to reality as possible
  -  Resizable 2D panels

Project enhancements and ongoing work:

  Complete English documentation and comments: 
    All system DataRefs, custom scripts, and code comments are systematically translated from Russian to clear, technical English. 
    This includes electrical, hydraulic, fuel, anti-ice, engine, alarm, checklist, payload, panel, and all custom failure DataRefs, as well as cockpit and panel logic. 
    This is done to further the accesibility for dev´s who don´t speak Russian.  
  
  System-by-system Lua refactoring: 
    Every Lua script is currenty being rewritten for compatibility with the latest SASL plugin and X-Plane 12, using modern, modular, and optimized coding practices.
    This will improve the code performance and enhance the stability.
  
  Extensive developer documentation: 
    All DataRefs are currenty being cross-checked, clarified, and structured for a future-proof developer environment, 
    allowing easy expansion and troubleshooting by the community.
  
  Accurate electrical and power logic: 
    The entire electrical system, including all bus logic (27V, 36V, 115V), generator, battery, and transformer behavior, 
    has been redesigned and re-validated based on real-world documentation, enabling advanced failure modes and realistic power consumption modeling.
  
  Custom failures and safe state logic: 
    Engine, APU, anti-ice, and avionics failures have been reworked to reflect real Tu-154M behavior, with detailed logic for thermal, electrical, and procedural faults.
  
  SmartCopilot-ready logic: 
    All system scripts are continuously reviewed and updated to ensure compatibility with SmartCopilot multi-crew operations, supporting master/slave data sync and cross-network flight.
  
  Modern code standards: 
    All code now uses structured batch DataRef definitions, avoids block comments, and features unified technical comments in English.
  
  Open, modular, and community-oriented: 
    The codebase is continuously improved for maintainability, with every DataRef and system mapped, named, and documented for ease of use and transparency.

Planned for the future:

    -  SmartCopilot profiles and full multi-crew compatibility
    -  Additional failures and abnormal procedures
    -  Full interactive manuals and checklists


Special thanks to:

    -  Felis, the original author of the Tu-154M project, for his years of dedicated work, accuracy, and for open-sourcing the aircraft and its systems.
    -  Unicode4all, who took over as lead developer and maintainer for the Community Edition, coordinating the migration to X-Plane 12 and modern SASL, managing the English documentation, 
       and driving community contributions.
    -  Belavia staff for providing extensive documentation, photos, and videos of this exact aircraft.
    -  Andrey Belov for ground vehicle models.

System requirements: X-Plane 12, X-Plane 11
