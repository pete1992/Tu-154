✈️ About the Project


After the original project by Felis was made open source, 
Unicode4all launched the first community project. This repository builds on top of that foundation with:


-	Continued compatibility updates for X-Plane 12
-	Internal code improvements (Lua/SASL)
-	Full English translation of codebase and comments
-	Numerous bug fixes


A stronger open-source focus and documentation improvements


> 🚧 This is an ongoing project. All contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome!
